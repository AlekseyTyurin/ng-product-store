    "description": "The SuperSix EVO Black Inc. makes crushing the competition a formal affair. With its unrivaled blend of stiffness, aerodynamics, low weight, and smooth-riding compliance, you'll be armed with the winning edge on every part of the race course. Cannondale's SuperSix EVO Black Inc. is a beastly climber and a full-octane sprinter thanks to its full Hi-Mod carbon frame and dialed-in race geometry. With luxurious ENVE carbon rims and Schwalbe ONE clincher tires, you'll accelerate fast and maintain control even in tricky conditions. Shimano's best-of-the-best Dura-Ace Di2 drivetrain is primed to provide perfect gear shifts, while Dura-Ace caliper brakes are smooth, powerful, and unfailing in their performance. An ENVE carbon stem and handlebar create the command center, and a Fizik Arione saddle is supportive, lightweight, and svelte enough for the long haul or the final burst of speed.",
